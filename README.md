Ordering System for a pipe-selling company
Write an application that allows the customer to enter the details of his/her order and subsequently prompts the cost of the order. Your application should verify that LongPipes can supply the corresponding to the order type of pipe (the customer should not be asked to specify the pipe type).
Use OO design approach (abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism) and create appropriate class hierarchy, which reflects on the types of pipes that LongPipes sells. Use an abstract class as well.
Give UML use case diagram, UML class hierarchy diagram, one class and one instance diagrams.
Use proper level of abstraction, encapsulation and accessibility for the class attributes and methods. Application with no levels of abstraction will fail.
Devise suitable test plan and data, which you can use to test the performance of your ordering system.
